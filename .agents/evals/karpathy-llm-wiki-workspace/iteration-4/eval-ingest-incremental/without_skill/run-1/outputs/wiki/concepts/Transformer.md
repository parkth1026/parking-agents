# Transformer

Sequence-to-sequence architecture built entirely on [[Attention Mechanism]], replacing recurrence.

## Key Ideas
- Self-attention layers process all tokens in parallel
- Positional information injected via embeddings rather than order of computation

## Significance
Foundation of virtually every modern LLM; trained end-to-end on top of a standard [[Neural Network]] backbone. [[Flash Attention]] tames attention's quadratic memory cost (2-4x wall-clock speedup), making long-context Transformers practical.
